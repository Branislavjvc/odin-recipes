Have you got the time, but only a minute of it for cooking? Look no further because here you will find the solution to your cooking headaches!

A project about displaying lists and common website elements and navigating pages.
Wanting to come back to coding and continue where i left of a few years ago motivated me to finish this project.
Inspired from: www.theodinproject.com
